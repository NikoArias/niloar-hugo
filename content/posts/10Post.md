### London is blessed with beautiful bodies of water, so take a peek at these lovely lakes.
The next time somebody tells you that London is all concrete and no nature, tut loudly and send them a link to this article. Or, better still, take them to one of these beautiful lakes within the city. That’ll show them. Quite literally.

### Victoria Park


Boasting 86.18 hectares of open space, two boating lakes (one is for model boats only), a splash pool, and a Chinese pagoda, Victoria Park was voted the people’s favourite park back in 2014. (Yep, it’s still holding on to that one. I’m pretty sure there hasn’t been another competition since though, so it’s still technically the reigning champion). The West Boating Lake is probably the most scenic part, but little ‘uns will love the splash pool.

### The Serpentine, Hyde Park

Go for a swim, take out a pedalo or row row row your boat gently down the, er, Serpentine. Hyde Park is also home to the UK’s first Solarshuttle, a seriously impressive craft that floats silently across the lake, powered only by the sunshine! Afterwards, enjoy a meal or a drink at one of the cafes in the park and head to the Serpentine Galleries for a bit of art and some contemporary architecture.

### Regent’s Park


Regent’s Park is brilliant for a lot of reasons, including its extensive sports facilities and its open air theatre – but mostly because it has two boating lakes, including a separate one for children. Which of course means that your boat races and pirate raids will be amongst only those who are going to take the whole business seriously.
