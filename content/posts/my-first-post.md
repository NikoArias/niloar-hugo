Today, E-sports are for some more entertaining than any traditional sport and, according to a study, it has been proven that young people, both women and men, consume more these E-sports than any other traditional sport. Before we get into the impact of E-sports in real life, I will first focus on what they are.





### What are E-sports.


E-sports or electronic sports are a novelty in the field of video games. This concept is used to name competitions organized at a professional level. They are multiplayer competitions of different video game disciplines. Its operation is very simple: each E-sport has its own rules and they have access to different devices and platforms online or offline.

Although at first it may seem that the format would not be successful, an audience that would not enjoy watching as much as playing themselves, it has already been possible to see how these video game competitions in which viewers observe how other gamers play, interest the public.

### How many people follow eSports?


On a planet where 7.8 billion people live and with an online population of around 4.4 billion, almost half of that number know esports, according to the Newzoo report. Some data that must be taken with a certain critical attitude, although optimistic: In 2020, the total audience of esports will be 495 million viewers around the world, of which 223 million will be enthusiasts, the term used by Newzoo to define the people who consume esports content more than once a month. Among all countries, China stands out first and continues to grow. Of the 2 billion people who have heard of esports in the world, 530 million reside in China. Forecasts for 2020 assume audience growth of almost 12 percent compared to 443 million viewers in 2019.

### Are E-sports players professional athletes?


Lately, voices have emerged that consider professional eSports players to be professional athletes, given the specificity of their relationship and their similarities with said athletes. It should be noted that eSports players are subject to strict schedules, have long training sessions, have psychologists, nutritionists, physiotherapists and doctors within their clubs, suffer injuries due to their physical and mental exhaustion, signings are paid for them, they receive benefits for publicity acts and, above all, they are under the discipline of a club.

A singular note of professional athletes are the hours and their day. Professional players in the so-called “traditional sports” are subject to very strict training schedules, events, pre-match concentrations, competitions, tournaments, etc., which are adapted and subject to sports calendars. The same happens with eSports players who are subject to multiple hours of training, concentrate in gaming houses, travel to different tournaments and must attend events. Likewise, video game leagues set their own schedules and calendars in order to reach more public, and we must not forget that more and more televisions are betting on these sporting events.
