Sophia has artificial intelligence software that allows her to maintain eye contact with people, from which she can retain information and even recognize their faces, as well as being able to trace the human personality: she can have a conversation, explain jokes, etc. Is that not amazing? Sophia is a humanoid (gynoid) robot developed by the Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics.

It has been designed to learn, adapt to and work with human behavior successfully. She has been interviewed around the world and in October 2017, she became a Saudi citizen, thus being the first robot with citizenship of a country.

### Software

Ben Goertzel, the scientist who created the robot brain, used different technologies so that Sophia could get as close as possible to human thought. Many people wonder how the head of this robot works. Goertzel explains that Sophia's software could be divided into three main configurations:

1. An information search platform and a system that allows you to communicate what you are observing.

2. A voice system, where texts and responses that Sophia uses when interpreting her environment can be preloaded; then the facial expressions related to what is being said are automatically joined.

3. A dialogue tool, where you analyze what you are hearing and use prescribed information and the internet to develop an appropriate response. Similar to how Siri works.

To make this possible, he carried out software that allowed the development of several necessary functions: mainly, the software searches for information so that Sophia can communicate it in response to the questions asked, as well as express and explain what surrounds her. This software has in its configuration a voice system, where all the answers are developed and, in general, everything that Sophia says about her environment. This element is linked to their facial expressions, which depend on the text that the robot says, that is, they are in relation to what it says. Finally, the software analyzes everyone who listens and then with the network can search for information to create the best possible response.

### History

Sophia was activated on April 19, 2015.1 She is inspired by actress Audrey Hepburn, and is known for her human appearance and demeanor compared to previous robotic variants. According to the manufacturer, David Hanson, Sophia has artificial intelligence (AI), visual data processing, and facial recognition. Sophia also mimics human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and have simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. weather) .2 The robot uses speech recognition technology from Alphabet Inc, (parent company of Google) and is designed with learning capabilities. Sophia's intelligence software is designed by SingularityNET.3 Her AI software analyzes conversations and extracts data that allows her to improve her responses over time. It is conceptually similar to the ELIZA computer program, which was one of the first attempts to simulate a human conversation.
