### About robotic surgery
Robotic surgery was quickly adopted in hospitals in the United States and Europe as a treatment for a wide range of conditions.

The most widely used clinical robotic surgical system features a camera arm and mechanical arms, and surgical instruments mounted on them. The surgeon controls the arms while seated at a computer console near the operating table. The console provides the surgeon with a high definition magnified three-dimensional view of the surgical site. The surgeon leads other team members who help during the operation.

Advantage
Surgeons using the robotic system find that in various procedures it improves precision, flexibility and control during the operation and allows them to see the site better, compared to traditional techniques. By using robotic surgery, surgeons can perform delicate and complex procedures that might have been difficult or impossible to perform with other methods.

Minimally invasive surgery is often possible thanks to robotic surgery. Some benefits of minimally invasive surgery are as follows:

- Fewer complications, such as infections at the surgery site
- Less pain and blood loss
- Faster recovery
- Smaller and less noticeable scars

# Risks
Robotic surgery carries risks, some of which may be similar to conventional open surgery, such as a slight risk of infection and other complications.

Is robotic surgery right for you?
Robotic surgery is not an option for everyone. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of robotic surgery, and how it differs from other techniques, such as other types of minimally invasive surgery and conventional open surgery.
