Advances in technology are happening at breakneck speed and 2020 is expected to be the year of the so-called great technological leap. Industries are rapidly preparing to enter a new era where robots, the Internet of Things (IoT) and other trends in innovation will take center stage today.
Every year new technologies come to our hands; When it comes time to renew the computer, mobile phone or other devices, or when we undergo a medical procedure, we are always benefiting from the latest advances that have reached the market. However, before we realize the advantages of these innovations, there is a long prior development process in which technologies must demonstrate their potential and viability. We review here six technological areas in full effervescence that according to experts will be in the focus of today during this 2020.

### SUPERCOMPUTERS TO EQUALIZE THE HUMAN BRAIN

The world's most powerful supercomputers currently reach a processing speed greater than petaflop, or a thousand trillion floating point operations per second, depending on the parameter used to measure the power of these giants. Summit, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), holds the current record with its 148.6 petaflops. But it will not be for long: the expected milestone of breaking the exaflop barrier, or a thousand petaflops, will become a reality this year in China, although it is not yet possible to specify in which specific place, since according to the journal Science three institutions compete for launch the first machine capable of exceeding the threshold of exascale supercomputing.
Other countries do not want to be left behind. The US Department of Energy has commissioned the construction of two exa-scale supercomputers, Aurora and Frontier, which are due to enter service in 2021. The European Union and Japan are working on their own projects. Beyond the increase in power, overcoming the frontier of exaflop has significant implications, since these machines will equalize the neural processing capacity of the human brain, thus providing the definitive boost to initiatives such as the Human Brain Project.

### MORE POWERFUL, CLEAN AND SAFE BATTERIES

The 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry honored John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino for the development of lithium ion batteries, the ingenuity that today powers electric cars from our mobile phones. But despite the fact that this technology developed in the 80s is still fully in force today, researchers are working on finding new sources of portable power that overcome current limitations to provide greater autonomy and faster charging.

This could be the year of confirmation of the next step: solid-state lithium-ion batteries, which replace the liquid or gel electrolyte with a solid one. It is a field in development for years, but has not yet achieved takeoff. According to Nature magazine, during the Tokyo Olympics the Toyota company will present a car powered by this system. Solid state batteries can store 2.5 times more energy, have a longer life and avoid toxic compounds and the risk of explosion than current ones. At the moment, its drawback is the high price.

### ENGINEERING AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

With the climate crisis being the most pressing global problem of our time, it is natural that growing technological areas increasingly include efforts to combat this scourge or mitigate its effects. One of these newly minted fields is geoengineering against climate change. In 2020, the first small-scale experiments could start to test a controversial approach: is it possible to compensate for warming by artificially reducing the amount of solar radiation the Earth receives?
The controversy surrounding the possible benefits and harms of these projects has been delaying the start of the Controlled Stratospheric Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx), led by Harvard University. The idea consists of using a propelled balloon to disperse an aerosol of particles of calcium carbonate, a material that is harmless in principle, in a small sector of the sky in order to partially shield the sun's radiation. The SCoPEx results, together with the information gleaned from the simulation models, could tip these investigations towards further progress or a dead end.
