In collaboration with BMW, Peter Salzman, pioneer of the Irish parachute saint, designed an electric wingsuit called a "wingsuit" that powers his flight and allows him to reach speeds of 300 kilometers per hour. The new suit is powered by a chest-mounted rig and produces a total power of 15 kW. This amount is divided into two 7.5 kW carbon impellers that rotate at a speed of 25,000 RPM and produce a thrust of up to five minutes. The new device was developed for three years and successfully tested.

BMW believed it could fly and now it’s proved it. The German marque just successfully sent air sports pioneer Peter Salzmann soaring through the sky at speeds of up to 186 mph in a newly developed electric wingsuit. The innovative concept was a joint effort between BMW, Designworks and Salzmann. The professional skydiver and BASE jumper said the idea arose while he was thinking of ways to improve performance in the air.

“One of them was a supporting motor—and it’s an idea I just couldn’t shake,” Salzmann told BMW. “I found the idea of being able to jump from my local mountain wearing the wingsuit and land in my garden fascinating.”
