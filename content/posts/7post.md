## Art.


{{< figure src="/img/abcd.jpg" title="Art" >}}



Art (from Latin ars) is the concept that encompasses all creations made by humans to express a sensitive vision about the world, whether real or imaginary. Through plastic, linguistic or sound resources, art allows to express ideas, emotions, perceptions and sensations.

History indicates that, with the appearance of Homo Sapiens, art had a ritual and magical-religious function, which changed over time. However, the definition of art varies according to the time and the culture.


With the Italian Renaissance, at the end of the 15th century, a distinction began to be made between crafts and fine arts. The artisan is one who is dedicated to producing multiple works, while the artist is the creator of unique works.

It is precisely in the Italian Renaissance where we find one of the most important stages in the History of Art, both for the magnificent artists who worked on it and for the surprising works that they undertook and that today are praised throughout the world.

Thus, for example, we would have to highlight figures of the stature of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Donatello, Titian or Raphael. And in terms of works we would highlight, for example, “La Gioconda”, “La Capilla Sistina”, “Gattamelata”, “Venus de Urbino” and “Los esposorios de la Virgen” respectively.

The classification used in ancient Greece included six disciplines within art: architecture, dance, sculpture, music, painting, and poetry (literature). Later, cinema began to be included as the seventh art. There are also those who name photography as the eighth art (although it is often claimed that it is an extension of painting) and comic strips as the ninth (its detractors indicate that it is, in fact, a bridge between painting and cinema) . Television, fashion, advertising and video games are other disciplines that are sometimes considered artistic.

In this sense, it should be noted that UNESCO is dedicated to cataloging those artistic works and monuments that have incalculable value and incomparable beauty. In this case, we could speak, for example, of the Mosque of Córdoba, the Alhambra of Granada, the Cathedral of Seville or the Archaeological Site of Atapuerca.

However, all over the world there are monuments that receive this same cataloging. Among them are the Tiwanaku Temple in Bolivia, the Chiloé Churches in Chile, the historic center of Lima or the Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca in Santiago de Cuba.

And all this without forgetting the Royal Palaces of Abomey in Benin, Chichen Itza in Mexico, the Statue of Liberty in the United States, the necropolises of Egypt, the Church of the Nativity in Palestine or Durham Castle in the United Kingdom. .

With the passage of time, artistic creations often suffer significant deterioration. For this reason, the set of processes dedicated to the preservation of these cultural assets for the future is known as conservation and restoration of works of art.

In addition to all the above we have to emphasize that the term art is also used to refer to the skill or cunning that a person has to carry out a specific task.
