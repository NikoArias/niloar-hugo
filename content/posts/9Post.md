Smart homes are those in which electrical, gas or water installations are remotely monitored and controlled from an electronic device. Usually it is usually the mobile or the computer. In this post we tell you how they work and all the benefits they can bring.


### Advantages of smart homes

The automation of homes, thanks to telemetry and home automation, is serving to have custom houses, adjusted to the particular needs of each individual. The interactions that can be carried out can be designed to guarantee the following questions:

- Security.
- Comfort.
- Energy saving.

### Security

A smart home can warn you the moment there is a water leak before the leak appears, just as it can detect fires before seeing the fire.

The system is not only capable of detecting it and sending the warning, but it can also act accordingly until the arrival of the specialist. With smart homes, in addition, you will be able to control the cameras in real time from your mobile, wherever you are.

### Comfort

Smart homes increase user comfort. Thanks to home automation you can select before you get home, from the temperature of the house to the lighting.

The capabilities of smart homes are vast. Everything that has to do with turning on and off electronic devices and lighting and air conditioning installations, combined with the incorporation of presence, temperature or any other type of sensors, make the customization possibilities of smart homes almost infinite.

### Energy saving


In addition to the security and comfort that smart homes provide, the capacity of these systems for energy saving and efficiency is very important. The design of smart home facilities includes efficient electronic devices that, through their integrated management, manage to generate savings in water, electricity and fuel.

Examples of smart home savings
Some examples of functionalities that the smart home allows to achieve savings are:


- The scheduling of the use of household appliances in hours of less electricity demand, when electricity is cheaper
- The integration of lighting with presence sensors in corridors, so that lighting is only switched on when needed.
- The control of the opening of awnings and blinds using natural light sensors, for the maximum use of sunlight.
- The regulation of the temperature inside the house to reduce the use of air conditioning to the bare minimum, taking into account the weather outside, the time of day and the presence of people.
- Intelligent irrigation control through a sensor that detects soil moisture, and irrigates only when necessary.
