When the Apple Watch appeared in 2015, it wasn't just a new product - it was Apple's entry into wearable products, a market it had previously avoided. Unfortunately, without an interface tradition to lean on, it was difficult for Apple to achieve the same levels of intuitive usability that it had achieved on the Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

Obviously, Apple wasn't going to give up, so the company forged a new design language. The Apple Watch features multiple control methods: a touchscreen sensitive to two degrees of pressure, a button and a dial, plus voice control, and numerous third-party apps that take different approaches to an interface that took a few years to establish.

All of this means that the Apple Watch is packed with secret features and hidden potential. In this article, we share our tips and secrets to help you get the most out of your watch, from vital interface techniques to obscure tricks for optimizing app behavior. And we will update it periodically to add new features from the latest WatchOS software updates.

### Download applications directly to your Apple Watch

Since the watchOS 6 update, it has been possible to install apps on an Apple Watch without using the accompanying iPhone. The watch now has its own App Store. Just like on the iPhone, it exists as a standalone app, and you can open it from the standard apps view or even from the dock, if you've put it there.

The problem is that text input is more difficult on a smaller screen; Both voice dictation and scribble writing are offered on the screen, but it may be easier to use the iPhone anyway. It's certainly easier to navigate through the multiple tabs of the iOS and iPadOS versions of the App Store.

### Watch the Control Center

Going through the watch face reveals the Control Center. You will see how much life is left to the battery; tap the percentage figure to easily access the Power Reserve if you need to conserve power.

There is also an airplane mode, a cinema mode (indicated by two masks, which prevents the screen from lighting up unless touched), a silent mode, Do not disturb, a flashlight, a ping button to locate your phone and a button AirPlay to listen to music from your Apple Watch with wireless headphones or a Bluetooth speaker.

In addition, if you use a waterproof model (Series 2 or later) there will also be a hydraulic seal, indicated by a drop icon. This turns off the touchscreen so it won't wake up when moving the shower or pool water (once it's on, you won't be able to tap the icon to turn it off. Turn the dial instead).

### Share your location from Apple Watch

All you have to do is open the Messages app on your Apple Watch and select a thread to reply to, and instead of dictating a reply, force touch the screen and select "Send location."

This will take the current location of your iPhone and send it to everyone on the thread, which in this case is all the friends you are going to meet. They can load your location from the message app and easily see where you are. It is very simple.
