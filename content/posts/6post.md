We know that gaming is evolving constantly. With the way things are going, it seems that the controller may become an artifact of gaming, much like the joystick from the 1970s and 1980s. How could such a thing happen? Controllers are essential. Well, if these virtual reality companies have anything to say about it, our bodies will be the only controllers we need.

This extends to further aspects, like apps and video technologies.

Out of these companies, who stands out? Who’s leading the way? In this list of virtual reality companies, I’ll show you who and what just might be the ‘next big thing’

-----------------------------------------

### Oculus VR

Oculus is a name you should know by now. Facebook purchased the company for a whopping $2 billion dollars in 2016. The team even included a famous gaming visionary of id Software and ‘Doom’, John Carmack. Carmack eventually left Oculus over legal disputes with Zenimax, but Oculus hasn’t let that stop their creative engines from working overtime.
They’ve announced a standalone headset called the ‘Oculus Quest’ due to release in 2019. Oculus isn’t just a recognizable name in terms of VR companies, it’s *the* name to recognize.

### Google

Yes, Google is possibly going to be one of the heavy hitters in the VR world. Gone are the simple searches for “how to tie a tie’, and ‘pie recipes’. Google is now dabbling in VR technology. Their move onto the scene was brilliant. They released the ‘Google Cardboard’, a cardboard VR headset that cost $15.
It was specifically designed to put over your phone or smart device and interact with different apps and games. This led to their release, the Google Daydream View. It’s not hard to see that Google will continue to explore this world of VR and possibly branch out with a larger presence.

Is it possible that Google will be known as a VR company as well as a prolific search engine? Only time will tell.

### HTC Vive

The HTC Vive is a mix of The Matrix, Ready Player One, and the entire cyberpunk genre. HTC has released this headset for $799 (Current price is $599), distinguishing the professionals from the amateurs. It includes a headset, sensors for your room, and handheld devices. The thing I love about HTC is that they partnered with Valve on this project to make it more robust.
I imagine this extends to many VR Steam games as well. The reason they score so high is not only the technology in which they present but the fact that this VR company is partnering with one of my favorite companies to team up and revolutionize the VR field with tanklesslab.

With their hardware, you’re going to be moving all around the room, not just sitting in a solitary spot as you confusedly look around. Check out their Formula 1 racing software for a rush.

### Microsoft

Another big name, another possible heavy hitter as a VR company. Microsoft comes onto the list, showing that VR companies can also be big existing companies as well. A big thing Microsoft is focusing on is not only VR but Augmented reality. We should all be familiar with this, as it’s the main thing that fueled 2016’s Pokémon Go.
You’re able to see the Pokémon against the backdrop of our world: Pikachu in your room, onyx at the bookstore, and Snorlax in the park. Microsoft is now releasing the HoloLens, which supports not only games but practical applications as well. I think that’s an important factor when it comes to VR companies: is it just games? Or is it a wide array of different uses?
This, I believe, sets companies apart from the innovators from the one-trick ponies.

### Samsung

Many names we already know from our everyday life are making appearances here. They do so because, luckily for them, they already have a leg-up in technology, and Samsung is no stranger to technology, and this includes VR. Samsung did something pretty smart: they developed the Samsung Gear, a VR headset with the help of Oculus.
At $129.99, it’s a more palatable purchase for more casual users than products like the Vive. It’s for your phone, and you slip your phone right into the headset. Samsung has the enormous potential here, and I believe they can even begin developing games for their projects.
